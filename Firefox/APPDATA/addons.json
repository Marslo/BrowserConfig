Help bring vimperator into the age of e10s and WebExtensions!\n\nVimperator is a free browser add-on for Firefox, which makes it look and behave like the Vim text editor. It has similar key bindings and you could call it a modal web browser, as key bindings differ according to which mode you are in. For example, it has a special Hint mode, where you can follow links easily with the keyboard only. Also most functionality is available as commands, typing :back will go back within the current page history, just like hitting the back button in the toolbar.\n\nBut Vimperator is more than just a simple command interface to Firefox — it is a complete development environment as well. If you are a web developer, you can enjoy an interactive JavaScript shell — even with completion support. Or if you want to extend Vimperator, you can easily do that by just dropping a JavaScript file in its plugin directory.\n\nVimperator was initially written by Martin Stubenschrott but has found many other contributors in the meanwhile.\n\nIf there are any issues, please check out our issue tracker https://github.com/vimperator/vimperator-labs/issues and add the issue if it isn't already recorded.\n\n=== Features ===\n\n* Vim-like keybindings (h, j, k, l, gg, G, 0, $, ZZ, , etc.)\n* Ex commands (:quit, :open www.foo.com, ...)\n* Tab completion available for all commands with support for 'longest' matching when set in 'wildmode'\n* Extensions! Yes, you can extend Vimperator's functionality with scripts just like you can extend Firefox with extensions.\n* Explore JavaScript objects with :echo window and even context-sensitive tab completion.\n* Hit-a-hint like navigation of links (start with f to follow a link)\n* Advanced completion of bookmark and history URLs (searching also in title, not only URL)\n* Vim-like statusline with a wget-like progress bar\n* Minimal GUI (easily hide useless menubar and toolbar with :set guioptions=)\n* Ability to :source JavaScript files, and to use a ~/.vimperatorrc file\n* Easy quick searches (:open foo will search for \"foo\" in google, :open ebay terminator will search for \"terminator\" on ebay) with support for Firefox keyword bookmarks and search engines\n* Count supported for many commands (3 will go back 3 pages)\n* Beep on errors\n* Marks support (ma to set mark 'a' on a webpage, 'a to go there)\n* QuickMarks support (quickly go to previously marked web pages with go{a-zA-Z0-9})\n* :map and :command support (and feedkeys() for script writers)\n* :time support for profiling\n* Move the text cursor and select text with vim keys and a visual mode.\n* External editor support\n* Macros to replay key strokes\n* AutoCommands to execute action on certain events\n* A comprehensive :help, explaining all commands, mappings and options.\n* Much more...","isPlatformCompatible":true,"eula":null,"screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/58/58919.png?src=api&modified=1307285716","width":"568","height":"525","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/58/58919.png?src=api&modified=1307285716","thumbnailWidth":"162","thumbnailHeight":"150","caption":"Hints allow to follow links with the keyboard"},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/58/58920.png?src=api&modified=1307285716","width":"568","height":"525","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/58/58920.png?src=api&modified=1307285716","thumbnailWidth":"162","thumbnailHeight":"150","caption":"Vimperator's completion system"},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/58/58921.png?src=api&modified=1307285716","width":"568","height":"525","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/58/58921.png?src=api&modified=1307285716","thumbnailWidth":"162","thumbnailHeight":"150","caption":"Exploring the DOM of the web page"}],"averageRating":5,"learnmoreURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/vimperator/?src=api","homepageURL":"http://www.vimperator.org/","sourceURI":"https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/downloads/file/582324/vimperator-3.16.0-fx.xpi?src=api","size":465385,"contributionURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/vimperator/developers?src=api","contributionAmount":"$10.00","developerComments":null,"reviewURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/vimperator/reviews/?src=api","reviewCount":231,"totalDownloads":877154,"weeklyDownloads":1195,"dailyUsers":16842,"updateDate":1487370928000,"supportURL":"http://www.vimperator.org"},{"id":"autoproxy@autoproxy.org","icons":{"32":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/addon_icons/11/11009-32.png?modified=1354175987","64":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/addon_icons/11/11009-64.png?modified=1354175987"},"name":"AutoProxy","type":"extension","version":"0.4b2.2013051811.1-signed.1-let-fixed.1-signed","repositoryStatus":4,"creator":{"name":"lovelywcm","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/lovelywcm/?src=api"},"description":"Are you concerned about your privacy?

I just became aware of the new version on Dec. 8. 2014, but unfortunately, my time to check on this now, is limited. If you want to provide feedback, please use the support email on the homepage. Any information is welcome. If you experience any problems, you might either disable Stylish Sync or revert to Stylish 1.4.3. Anyway it might be a good idea to use Stylish Sync's backup facility before upgrading. Update: Preliminary tests seem to indicate, that the synchronization is still working. However, with Stylish 2.0.0 you lose the ability to preview your styles and to organize them by tags.\n    With Firefox 29.0 (\"New Sync\"), the sync-options dialog has changed, and you cannot en-/disable syncing from that dialog anymore. En-/Disabling from the add-on options is still possible.\n    There was a compatibility problem with Stylish 1.4.2. New styles won't get synced to other devices. Thanks a lot for the bug report. Unfortunately, these changes make version 0.1.7 incompatible with Stylish 1.4.1 and below. If you're still using Stylish 1.4.1 or lower, please get Stylish Sync 0.1.6 from the versions page or better yet, upgrade both add-ons.","isPlatformCompatible":true,"eula":null,"screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/68/68099.png?src=api&modified=1330400884","width":"700","height":"360","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/68/68099.png?src=api&modified=1330400884","thumbnailWidth":"200","thumbnailHeight":"102","caption":"Default options"}],"averageRating":5,"learnmoreURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/stylishsync/?src=api","homepageURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/stylishsync/?src=api","sourceURI":"https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/downloads/file/250582/stylish_sync-0.1.7-fx+sm.xpi?src=api","size":29049,"contributionURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/stylishsync/developers?src=api","contributionAmount":"$1.99","developerComments":"Unfortunately, Stylish doesn't allow to synchronize its data with Mozilla's sync service.\n\nThis extension adds the missing functionality.","reviewURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/stylishsync/reviews/?src=api","reviewCount":25,"totalDownloads":221977,"weeklyDownloads":188,"dailyUsers":3663,"updateDate":1395593284000,"supportURL":"https://code.google.com/p/stylishsync/wiki/README"},{"id":"{77d2ed30-4cd2-11e0-b8af-0800200c9a66}","icons":{"32":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/addon_icons/295/295337-32.png?modified=1499307620","64":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/addon_icons/295/295337-64.png?modified=1499307620"},"name":"FT DeepDark","type":"theme","version":"14.3.4.1","repositoryStatus":4,"creator":{"name":"steva","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/steva/?src=api"},"description":"Smooth dark theme for Firefox\n> Beta version available on the FT DeepDark's \"version history\" page","fullDescription":"\"FT DeepDark\" is a theme which has been created to transform the look of Firefox for Windows users. It has been specially designed for Windows 7 (with Aero Style enabled), but it can also be installed on other Windows versions and Linux (just be aware that some things may look different due to differences between platforms). It does NOT officially support Aurora/Firefox Developer Edition, Nightly and any Firefox forked versions (such as Palemoon, Cyberfox, Waterfox, etc.). It is not officially available for MAC, because I can't offer support for this platform in case of issues.\nIt contains no added functionalities, it's simply a full Firefox's GUI aesthetic customization.\n\n• Userstyles to customize a bit more your FT Deepdark (such as : dark \"about:home\", \"aero style\" for tabs and tab bar background, translucent scrollbars, darker url bar background, ...) are available at userstyles.org\n• IMPORTANT ! To use these \"userstyles\" you need first to install an add-on called \"Stylish\"\n\n\n>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> IMPORTANT <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<\n\nCONCERNS MULTIPROCESSING COMPATIBILITY WITH FIREFOX 54+\nAll complete themes do disable multiprocess mode. This means that it is not an issue specifically related to my theme. Any complete theme you can install will disable it.\nThis was a preventative measure applied by Mozilla to avoid any compatibility problems. Unfortunately there's no easy way to work around this, so users who want to use my theme will be stuck with single-process mode until the programmed end of complete themes (starting Firefox 57). Thanks for your understanding\n\n>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>><<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<\n\n• Before posting a review, please take the time to read first the review guidelines described here: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/review_guide. Thank you.\n\n\n• WHAT TO DO WHEN FACING AN ISSUE WITH FT DEEPDARK?\n\n1) before reporting it, first try to see if the issue is due to the theme itself. How ? Enable the default theme and check if the issue is still there. If not, enable again the FT theme, but disable all other installed addons to check if the issue can be due to a conflict between addons.\n\n2) If the issue is still there after disabling all other addons and if the default theme doesn t have that issue, try to download and install again the theme (check also if you have the latest version installed, maybe the bug you want to report has already been solved with the latest updates).\n\n3) if after trying what mentioned above the problem is linked with the use of the FT theme, please, send me an e-mail (there is a link on the add-ons page to contact me) instead of reporting the bug in the add-on's review section. When sending an e-mail to report a bug, do not forget to tell me which operating system (Windows XP, 7, Vista, Linux, etc.) you are running on your computer, which version of Firefox and FT theme you are using and if you have any operating system custom theme (it can also be a cause of the issue). Then, describe the most precisely you can the issue you are facing and, if possible, please, join a screenshot and/or a short video so I could see exactly how it looks (English is not my mother tongue, so a picture can avoid the language problems). All that will help me to understand better what is the problem and to solve it quicker if possible.\nI can t promise you that I ll manage to fix every problems and also in short time, but I ll do my best for it.

It also works with most video sites like DailyMotion, Facebook, Periscope, Vimeo, Twitch, Liveleak, Vine, UStream, Fox, Bloomberg, RAI, France 2-3, Break, Metacafe and thousands others.\n\nVideo DownloadHelper supports several types of streamings, making the add-on unique amongst Video downloaders: HTTP, MP2T, F4F, … Whenever a site uses a non-supported streaming technology, Video DownloadHelper is also able to capture directly from the screen and generate a video file out of it.\n\nAs a bonus, Video DownloadHelper can also record Twitter Periscope. Just specify search terms and the add-on will capture over night related live streams.\n\nAs another bonus, you can also use Video DownloadHelper to capture a full browsing session, optionally highlighting the mouse position and generate a video file out of it. This is ideal to create Web a site demos as a video.\n\nBesides downloading, Video DownloadHelper is also able to make video conversion (changing audio and video formats) and aggregation (joining separate audio and video to a single file) very easy. This is a commercial feature that helps paying for the free stuff (we need to eat too). You are not compelled to use conversion for downloading videos from web sites, and you can avoid picking variants marked as ADP to avoid the need for aggregation.\n\nWhen you first install the extension, your browser is redirected to a welcome page with links to a user manual at http://www.downloadhelper.net/howto.php.\n\nThis does not change your homepage setting and the welcome page won't appear anymore.\n\nYou may want to watch this video about using Video DownloadHelper 5: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xhqUx-b5-bE\n\nSupport can be obtained from http://www.downloadhelper.net/support.php.\n\nIf you want to test developments version, check this forum https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/video-downloadhelper-5.\n\nPlease stay tuned by following us on Twitter (@downloadhelper), Google + or Facebook.\n\nIf you enjoy the free service from Video DownloadHelper, we would appreciate a donation (or BTC: 1Eqe8DN6uJwVcHoqyfCPpMy6Q5FzjqcWLZ) or leave a nice review here or on any other media.","isPlatformCompatible":true,"eula":null,"screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/25/25993.png?src=api&modified=1469089560","width":"200","height":"150","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/25/25993.png?src=api&modified=1469089560","thumbnailWidth":"200","thumbnailHeight":"150","caption":"Video DownloadHelper"},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/154/154820.png?src=api&modified=1469089560","width":"327","height":"124","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/154/154820.png?src=api&modified=1469089560","thumbnailWidth":"200","thumbnailHeight":"76","caption":"Video DownloadHelper animated toobar icon"},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/154/154824.png?src=api&modified=1469089560","width":"250","height":"200","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/154/154824.png?src=api&modified=1469089560","thumbnailWidth":"188","thumbnailHeight":"150","caption":"Video DownloadHelper main panel"},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/154/154822.png?src=api&modified=1469089560","width":"361","height":"289","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/154/154822.png?src=api&modified=1469089560","thumbnailWidth":"187","thumbnailHeight":"150","caption":"Video DownloadHelper main panel"},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/154/154826.png?src=api&modified=1469089560","width":"320","height":"317","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/154/154826.png?src=api&modified=1469089560","thumbnailWidth":"151","thumbnailHeight":"150","caption":"Video DownloadHelper available actions"},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/154/154828.png?src=api&modified=1469089560","width":"293","height":"250","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/154/154828.png?src=api&modified=1469089560","thumbnailWidth":"176","thumbnailHeight":"150","caption":"Video DownloadHelper quality variants settings"}],"averageRating":4,"learnmoreURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/video-downloadhelper/?src=api","homepageURL":"http://www.downloadhelper.net/","sourceURI":"https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/downloads/file/639980/video_downloadhelper-6.3.1-fx.xpi?src=api","size":788307,"developerComments":null,"reviewURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/video-downloadhelper/reviews/?src=api","reviewCount":8132,"totalDownloads":228579322,"weeklyDownloads":205663,"dailyUsers":3599871,"updateDate":1494292731000,"supportURL":"http://www.downloadhelper.net/support.php"},{"id":"firebug@software.joehewitt.com","icons":{"32":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/addon_icons/1/1843-32.png?modified=1488334821","64":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/addon_icons/1/1843-64.png?modified=1488334821"},"compatibilityOverrides":[{"type":"incompatible","minVersion":"0","maxVersion":"1.7.3","appID":"{ec8030f7-c20a-464f-9b0e-13a3a9e97384}","appMinVersion":"6.0a1","appMaxVersion":"*"}],"name":"Firebug","type":"extension","version":"2.0.19","repositoryStatus":4,"creator":{"name":"Joe Hewitt","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/joe-hewitt/?src=api"},"developers":[{"name":"Jan Odvarko","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/jan-odvarko/?src=api"},{"name":"robcee","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/robcee/?src=api"},{"name":"Firebug Working Group","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/firebugworkinggroup/?src=api"}],"description":"Firebug integrates with Firefox to put a wealth of development tools at your fingertips while you browse.

It has a simple interface and it downloads videos directly from YouTube. The extension integrates with YouTube's interface and adds a download button below the player.","fullDescription":"Update (May 3, 2017): The extension doesn't support the new YouTube interface yet, so you won't see the download button. You can go back to the old interface by clicking the 3-dot icon at the top of a YouTube page and then picking \"restore classic YouTube\".\n\n\"Download YouTube Videos as MP4\" adds a button to the YouTube video pages, so you can download videos. The download button is displayed below the video player and it looks like any other YouTube button. The extension doesn't include ads and only links to YouTube's download URLs.\n\nHow to use it? After installing the extension, go to YouTube.com and click a video. You'll notice a new \"Download\" button below the player. Click the button and you can select one of the formats that are available.\n\n\nWhat are the download options?\n\nHere are the formats you can download using this extension:\n\n* MP4 360p (480x270, 480x360) - all videos are available in this format. Use it if you want to play videos on an old mobile phone (iPhone 3GS, HTC Desire, Samsung Galaxy S2) or to save space.\n* MP4 720p (1280x720) - HD format, available for an increasing number of videos. Use this format if you want to play higher quality videos on a tablet, laptop or a phone with HD display.\n* 480p and 1080p are no longer available as standalone videos downloaded from youtube.com. YouTube switched to adaptive streams and uses separate files for video and audio, which need to be merged to get a video file. This is more complicated and requires more advanced tools (ffmpeg), so I haven't added them yet.\n\n\nHow to watch the downloaded videos?\n\nAfter downloading videos, you can play them using free applications like:\n* VLC (Windows, Mac, Linux / play both MP4 and FLV videos) - recommended video player\n* Windows Media Player 12 for Windows 7/8 (play only MP4 videos)\n* iTunes and QuickTime Player (Windows, Mac / play only MP4 videos).\n\nUsing a different browser? The extension is based on a Greasemonkey script. If you use Chrome, Opera, Safari or Internet Explorer, install the userscript.\n\nCredits: The extension has been originally created by Arpit Kumar.","isPlatformCompatible":true,"eula":null,"screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/175/175546.png?src=api&modified=1466768693","width":"463","height":"371","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/175/175546.png?src=api&modified=1466768693","thumbnailWidth":"187","thumbnailHeight":"150","caption":"The download button is placed below the YouTube player"},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/175/175547.png?src=api&modified=1466768696","width":"674","height":"492","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/175/175547.png?src=api&modified=1466768696","thumbnailWidth":"200","thumbnailHeight":"146"},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/175/175548.png?src=api&modified=1466768696","width":"366","height":"249","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/175/175548.png?src=api&modified=1466768696","thumbnailWidth":"200","thumbnailHeight":"136","caption":"Click the button to see the video formats that are available."}],"averageRating":4,"learnmoreURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/download-youtube/?src=api","homepageURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/download-youtube/?src=api","sourceURI":"https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/downloads/file/590562/download_youtube_videos_as_mp4-1.8.10-fx+sm.xpi?src=api","size":25174,"developerComments":null,"reviewURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/download-youtube/reviews/?src=api","reviewCount":515,"totalDownloads":26050373,"weeklyDownloads":83007,"dailyUsers":880190,"updateDate":1487076659000,"supportURL":"https://github.com/gantt/downloadyoutube"}]}
